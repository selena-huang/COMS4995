Inital ideas:
- a choose-your-own-adventure type novel game
  - written in C++, working in Unity
- Website to host personal writing, blog-type pages
  - Javascript and html

Chosen project:
- A website recommending skincare routine based on selection and mood/state on that day.
- edit 10/13: it seems that this will be harder than I thought so it will attempt to do the above but starting with just creating a list and being able to edit the list. This may end up similar to a random buzzfeed quiz and spitting out answers.
